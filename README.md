## Path to a career in engineering
> This guide is for anyone who desires to start a career in engineering; especially those with limited education and no prior experience. 

### Stage 0 
> No HS diploma or haven't been in school for a **long** time
- Get in the habit of reading regularly - ~~most~~ engineers read a lot.
  - Topics are unimportant at this stage, but I recommend self-improvement and motivational books.
  - Here are some suggestions: [How to win friends...](https://amzn.to/3OYEEjQ), [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3c98RhH), [7 Habits...](https://amzn.to/3atBNk9), [The 48 Laws...](https://amzn.to/3O2i3S4), [Autobio of Malcolm X...](https://amzn.to/3c99fNb) and [The Subtle Art...](https://amzn.to/3IBKmpp).
  - Reading books on tech at this stage may be difficult, but if you can comprehend them, read them!
- You either need to prepare for the GED or refresh your HS education, so start to work on your skills in grammar and writing. 
  - Consider learning MLA format for essays or something similar. 

- Build up your math skills.
  - **Start at the level you feel comfortable with**; don't feel compelled to jump ahead because you are older or want to cut corners. Complex math is built on the foundation of simpler math. Don't jump to algebra, until you have arithmetic down. Don't jump to calculus until you have algebra (and trig) down.
  - Community College is a great place to start, so I recommend preparing for the [Accuplacer](https://amzn.to/3NSMASo), COMPASS or similar college prep exam.
  - I recommend studying independently until you get at least to college level algebra. If you have taken your time to build up to the college algebra level, your confidence will improve and the probability of success in engineering will increase. 
- Take the Accuplacer (or similar) exam once you feel you are ready.
  - The goal should be to get placed into courses that can be transfer to a 4-year university. Try to avoid developmental course placement if possible. 
 
### Stage 1
> Enroll in community college and look for the target university you plan to transfer to.
- In your first year at community college (two semesters, three including summer) take courses in math, science, intro to computer science (programming) and English (**engineers need to communicate very well**).
  - If you have the space to do so, take an intro to engineering course as well. 
- Obviously this can be more difficult if you have a job, children or other time constraints so it is important to develop disciplined time management skills. 
  - Audit where your time goes and ways you can be more efficient.
  - Dedicate as much time as you have available to studying while finding time for breaks so that you prevent mid semester burnouts. 
  - Stay on top of your school work, treat it as if you have finals from day one.
- Aim for the highest GPA you can get, near 3.5 +/- 0.3, to be sure to qualify for most programs smoothly. 
- Most universities will list there minimum amount of credits they will accept before allowing you to apply to transfer.
  - Computer Science may have more applicants but will be less restrictive on the courses needed to transfer in usually.
  - Engineering (Electrical, Computer, etc) will have fewer applicant but will require more restrictive courses to transfer in usually.
  - For example, C.S my not require pre-calc and physics but computer engineering may require those for admittance. Trying to transfer into a program without the necessary prerequisites may result in being designated a undecided/undeclared major student. Meaning you will be in the university, but not the desired department yet. You'd need to apply to the department once the prerequisites have been met. 
- 12 credits minimum to qualify for financial aid.
  - If you have financial restrictions, consider applying for Pell grants.
- You want to transfer to an ABET accredited engineering and/or computer science. (Some of the ivy leagues don't follow this req).
- By this time, you want to have built small programs and have applied some of the programming skills you have learned.

### Stage 2
> Transfer to a 4-year university 
- Scheduling may be more challenging if you work or have kids as the majority of your courses will be during the day.
- **Important** universities change the course curriculum periodically so meet with your academic advisor every semester to make sure the coursework you are taking or planning to take is still applicable to the degree you are pursing. 
- Once you are in your sophomore year, you should start to look for internship opportunities in your desired area.
  - Internships are available throughout the school year, not just summer. 
- Take courses in data structures and algorithms around this time if scheduling permits.
- Now is a good time to start looking at job descriptions that you are interested in so that you can take electives that are more targeted.
  - You will need to get in the habit of learning technologies outside of the courses you are taking.

### Stage 3
> Advanced courses, internships, pivoting or continuing the engineering path
- There will be a lot of project based work for your courses.
  - These can be used as projects to put on your resume.
  - This is a good time to start building up a portfolio.
  - Programming projects are valuable for electrical and computer engineers as well. 
- Start looking for jobs that align with your career path.
  - Embedded, software, hardware focused, project management, etc.
 - You may have gotten to this point and realized that you are a better fit in a different area of the tech space, you want to look for ways you can pivot to that career choice before this point if possible.
 - You should start applying to jobs that are looking for new graduates at this time.
 - Refine your resume to one focused page that fits the job(s) you are looking for.
  - A myriad of new grads will be applying as well, so internships, GPA, classes taken and a well written resume will help you standout.
  
### Stage 4
> Enter the workforce
- Find a mentor at the company you were hired at, this is vital to your success.
  - Asks lots of questions.
  - give yourself a limit to how long you will try to solve the problem on your own. Don't wait too long though, ask questions. 
- You will need to learn a lot of new things relatively quickly.
- Share your opinions during meetings and team gatherings.
- Understand that imposter syndrome will come and go. No one expects you to know everything, ask questions when you have them.
