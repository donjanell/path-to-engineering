## Path to a career in engineering
> This guide is for anyone who desires to start a career in engineering; especially those with limited education and no prior experience. 

### Stage 0 
> No HS diploma or haven't been in school for a **long** time
- Get in the habit of reading regularly - ~~most~~ engineers read a lot
  - Topics are unimportant at this stage, but I recommend self-improvement and motivational books. Here is a list of my suggestions 
  - Reading books on tech at this stage may seem a bit archaic, but if you can comprehend them, read them!
- You either need to prepare for the GED, or refresh your HS education so start to work on your skills in grammar and writing 
  - Consider learning MLA format for essays or something similar 
- Here are some suggestions: [How to win friends...](https://amzn.to/3OYEEjQ), [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3c98RhH), [7 Habits...](https://amzn.to/3atBNk9), [The 48 Laws...](https://amzn.to/3O2i3S4), [Autobio of Malcolm X...](https://amzn.to/3c99fNb) and [The Subtle Art...](https://amzn.to/3IBKmpp)
- Start to build up your math skills.
  - **Start at the level you feel comfortable with**, don't feel compelled to jump ahead because you are older or want to cut corners. Math is built on the foundation of simpler math. Don't jump to algebra, until you have arithmetic down.
  - Community College is a great place to start, so I recommend preparing for the [Accuplacer](https://amzn.to/3NSMASo), COMPASS or similar college prep exam
  - I recommend studying independently until you get at least to college level algebra. If you have taken your time to build up to the college algebra level, your confidence and probability to become an engineer will increase. 
- Take the Accuplacer (or similar) exam
  - The goal here should be to get placed into transferable courses and avoid developmental courses
 
### Stage 1
> Enroll in community college and start to look for the target university you plan to transfer to.
- In your first year at community college (two semesters, three including summer) take courses in math, science, intro to computer science and English (engineers need to communicate very well)
  - If you have the space to do so, take an intro to engineering course as well. 
- Obviously this can be more difficult if you have a job, children or other time contraints so it is important to began disciplined time management skills. 
  - Audit where your time goes
  - Dedicate as much time as you have available to studying while finding time for breaks so that you prevent mid semester burnouts. 
  - Stay on top of your school work, treat it as if you have finals from day one
- Aim for the highest GPA you can get, near 3.5, to be sure to qualify for most programs smoothly. 
- Most universities will list there minimum amount of credits they will accept before allowing you to apply to transfer
  - Computer Science may have more applicants but will be less restrictive on the courses needed to transfer in
  - Engineering (Electrical, Computer, etc) will have fewer applicant but will require more restrictive courses to transfer in
  - For example, C.S my not require pre-calc and physics but engineering may require those for admitance. Trying to transfer into a program without the necesary prereqs may result in being designated a undecided/undeclared major student. 
- 12 credits minimum to qualify for financial aid
  - If you have financial restrictions, apply for pell grants
- You want to transfer to an ABET accredidate engineering and/or computer science. (Some of the ivy leagues don't follow this req)
- By this time, you want to have built small programs and have applied some of the programming skills you have learned

### Stage 2
> Transfer to a 4-year university 
- If you are working, scheduling may be a bit more challenging as the majority of your courses will be during the day
- **Important** universities change the course curriculum periodically so meet with your academic advisor every semester to make sure the coursework you are taking or planning to take is still applicable to the degree you are pursing. 
- Once you wrap up sophmore year, you should really start to look for internship opportunities in your desired area
  - Interships are available throughout the school year
- Courses in data structures and algorithms are time consumming bet invaluable
- Now is a good time to start looking at job descriptions that you are interested in so that you can take electives that are more targeted
  - You will need to get in the habit in getting learning technologies outside of the courses you are taking

### Stage 3
> Advanced courses, interships, pivoting or continuing the engineering path
- There will be a lot of project based work for your courses
  - These can be used as projects to put on your resume
  - This is a good time to start building up a portfolio especially if you are planning full-stack or frontend.
  - Programming projects are valuable for electrical and computer engineers as well. 
- Start looking for jobs that align with your career path
  - Embedded, software, hardware focused, project management, etc.
 - You may have gotten to this point and realized that you are a better fit in a different area of the tech space, you want to look for ways you can pivot to that career choice
 - You should start applying jobs that are looking for new graduates at this time
 - Refine your resume to one focused page that fits the job(s) you are looking for
  - A myriad of new grads will be applying as well, so internships and well written resumes will help you standout 
  
### Stage 4
> Enter the workforce
- Find a mentor at the company you were hired at, this is vital to your success
  - asks lots of questions
  - give yourself a limit to how long you will try to solve the problem on your own. Don't wait too long though, ask questions. 
- You will need to learn a lot of new things relatively quickly
- Share your opinions during meetings
- Understand that imposter syndrome will come and go. No one expects you to know everything, ask questions when you have them.
