## Path to a career in engineering
> This guide is for anyone who desires to start a career in engineering; especially those with limited education and prior experience. 

### Level 0 
> No HS diploma or haven't been in school for a long time
- Get in the habit of reading regularly - engineers read a lot
  - Topics are unimportant at this stage, but I always recommend self-help and motivational books. Here is a list of my suggestions 
  - Reading books on tech at this stage may seem a bit archaic, but if you can comprehend them, read them!
- You either need to prepare for the GED, or refresh you education so start to work on your skills in grammar and writing. Here are my suggestions
- Start to build up your math skills.
  - Start at the level you feel comfortable with, don't feel compelled to jump ahead because you are older or want to cut corners. Math is built on the foundation of simplier math. Don't jump to algebra, until you have arithetic down.
  - Community College is a great place to start, so I recommend preparing for the Accuplacer, COMPASS or similar college prep exam. Here are some book recomendations
  - I recommend studying independently until you get at least to college level algebra. If you have taking your time to build up to the college algebra level, your confidence in your ability to become an engineer will rise. 
- Take the accuplacer (or similar) exam
  - The goal here should be to get placed into transferable courses and avoid developmental courses
 
### Level 1
> Enroll in community college and start to look for the target university you plan to transfer to.
- In your first year at community college (two semesters, three including summer) take courses in math, science, intro to computer science and engish (engineers need to communicate very well)
  - If you have the space to do so, take an intro to engineering course as well. 
- Obviously this can be more difficult if you have a job, children or other time contraints so it is important to began disciplined time management skills. 
  - Audit where your time goes
  - Dedicate as much time as you have available to studying while finding time for breaks so that you prevent mid semester burnouts. 
  - Stay on top of your school work, treat it as if you have finals from day one
- Aim for the highest GPA you can get, near 3.5, to be sure to qualify for most programs smoothly. 
- Most universities will list there minimum amount of credits they will accept before allowing you to apply to transfer
  - Computer Science may have more applicants but will be less restrictive on the courses needed to transfer in
  - Engineering (Electrical, Computer, etc) will have fewer applicant but will require more restrictive courses to transfer in
  - For example, C.S my not require pre-calc and physics but engineering may require those for admitance. Trying to transfer into a program without the necesary prereqs may result in being designated a undecided/undeclared major student.
